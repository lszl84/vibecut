# Project Instructions

## Code Style

- prefer linear procedural/functional style over traditional OOP patterns
- prefer std::expected over exceptions
- prefer data-oriented programming with code/data separation over traditional OOP
- prefer simple and clear code over abstraction overuse
- do make use of modern c++ standard library in an idiomatic way
- prefer a small number of C++23 modules grouping similar functionality over splitting stuff into many files
- use comments sparingly
