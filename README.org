#+title: Vibecut: a vibe-coded video editor

* What is this?
This is a long-term experiment to see how viable vibe-coding with AI
agents is in 2026.

* The Goal
Create an advanced desktop application for video editing. Simpler than
Final Cut, but more advanced than iMovie. We want to use minimal
amount of manual code typing, and prefer written or spoken prompts.

* Tech Stack
** GNU+Linux
** C++23
** CMake
** GLFW + OpenGL 4
** ImGui

* Tasks
** Initial Setup
