- ~~clips can be connected from the clip list using key Q~~
- ~~clips should connect to the current frame indicated by the playhead~~
- ~~the connected clip should appear above the main timeline~~
- ~~the connected clip should have a connection line from the connection point (the beginning of the clip) to the timeline~~
- ~~the connected clip should be resizable just like a regular clip~~
- ~~connected clips can be moved by the user by dragging~~
- ~~connected clips can be selected and deleted~~
- ~~when the main timeline plays and the connected clip is encountered, the connected clip should play~~
- ~~the pixel height of connected clips should be the same as the clips in the main timeline~~
