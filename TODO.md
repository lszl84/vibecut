# VibeCut TODO

## The Project Feature
- When opening the program, we should have three buttons: New Empty Project, Open Project, New Project From Video. The first two are obvious, the third lets the user select a video and creates a new project with that video in the timeline
- The window title bar should show the path of the current project file
- The "Library" text on the left should be replaced with "Project"
- "Add..." should say "Add a Clip..."
- There should be buttons to save the current project and load a different project (alongside the add button)
- The Preview button should start playing the selected clip from the library. If the user hits space, OR starts interacting with the timeline, the preview play should stop
- There should be an ability to remove a clip from the library
- There should be a confirmation dialog when the user tries to exit the program with unsaved changes to the project
- The buttons to Export/PNG/open File from the bottom should be removed
- The Export button should be in the Project panel
- The Project Panel currently overlays on top of the preview UI. Instead, these two views should be just next to each other
