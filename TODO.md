- FIXED: The main menu is obstructed by clip list panel and the video preview
- The split clips functionality with B should also work for connected clips
- FIXED: When the playhead is above a connected audio clips extending beyond the main timeline and we pause the playback, and start the playback again, the played audio is incorrect (we hear sounds from before the playhead?)
- FIXED: the rendered waveform does not seem to match what is being played at the current playhead position
